Templates for all new projects are in the <code>/projects</code> folder and enhancements to existing projects should be in the <code>/alterations</code> folder of your template library.

Project templates can contain any possible type of transformation that FubuCsProjFile, including new gems or Nuget references and additions to the rakefile.

<Section title="Custom Csproj Files" id="custom">
To create a custom template for new csproj files, save your csproj file template to a file named <code>project.xml</code> in the project template folder.  Make sure that you follow the rules in <TopicLink name="csproj-files" /> for creating new csproj file templates.

See [this template from fubu.exe](https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubu/blob/master/templates/project/baseline/csproj.xml) for an example.

<Section title="Testing Projects" id="testing">
As far as templates go, there is no difference for _testing_ projects versus other projects.  The only thing that is different is that the templating engine will make a project reference from the testing project to the project that's being tested and copy all the system and nuget references from the original project to the new testing project.
